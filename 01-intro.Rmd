# Introduction
Welkom to my portfolio!

In my portfolio I try to give an impression of my programming skills. This is mainly in r but I also have some experience with bash.

This portfolio contains a number of chapters with assignments that I have made, it also contains my resume. The last chapter called machine learning is about a tutorial assignment in which I tried to learn more about machine learning.

I hope this portfolio will give you a good idea of my skills.

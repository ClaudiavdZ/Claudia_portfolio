# Looking ahead

I hope to graduate from my life science degree in the summer of 2022. I will start my graduation internship in September. During these internships I hope to gain more experience with zoology but also with programming. In the future I think it would be fun to work on a way to improve animal welfare, during animal experiments but also in livestock farming. For this reason I have delved further into machine learning because I believe that with machine learning many animal experiments will become superfluous. That's why I first looked into what it is and what it can be used for. I then worked on an assignment myself in which I try to train an algorithm to distinguish two different horse breeds. I used images of two different breeds for this, and trained the algorithm with supervised learning. that is, the data is labeled.

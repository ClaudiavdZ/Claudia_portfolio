   abstract = {We introduce Salmon, a lightweight method for quantifying transcript abundance from RNARNARNA-seq reads. Salmon combines a new dual-phase parallel inference algorithm and feature-rich bias models with an ultra-fast read mapping procedure. It is the first transcriptome-wide quantifier to correct for fragment GC-content bias, which, as we demonstrate here, substantially improves the accuracy of abundance estimates and the sensitivity of subsequent differential expression analysis.},

   abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an ever increasingly popular tool for transcriptome profiling. A key point to make the best use of the available data is to provide software tools that are easy to use but still provide flexibility and transparency in the adopted methods. Despite the availability of many packages focused on detecting differential expression, a method to streamline this type of bioinformatics analysis in a comprehensive, accessible, and reproducible way is lacking. Results: We developed the ideal software package, which serves as a web application for interactive and reproducible RNA-seq analysis, while producing a wealth of visualizations to facilitate data interpretation. ideal is implemented in R using the Shiny framework, and is fully integrated with the existing core structures of the Bioconductor project. Users can perform the essential steps of the differential expression analysis workflow in an assisted way, and generate a broad spectrum of publication-ready outputs, including diagnostic and summary visualizations in each module, all the way down to functional analysis. ideal also offers the possibility to seamlessly generate a full HTML report for storing and sharing results together with code for reproducibility. Conclusion: ideal is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/ideal/), and provides a solution for performing interactive and reproducible analyses of summarized RNA-seq expression data, empowering researchers with many different profiles (life scientists, clinicians, but also experienced bioinformaticians) to make the ideal use of the data at hand.},

   abstract = {Data exploration is critical to the comprehension of large biological data sets generated by high-throughput assays such as sequencing. However, most existing tools for interactive visualisation are limited to specific assays or analyses. Here, we present the iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) software package, which provides a general visual interface for exploring data in a SummarizedExperiment object. iSEE is directly compatible with many existing R/Bioconductor packages for analysing high-throughput biological data, and provides useful features such as simultaneous examination of (meta)data and analysis results, dynamic linking between plots and code tracking for reproducibility. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of iSEE by applying it to explore a range of real transcriptomics and proteomics data sets.},
